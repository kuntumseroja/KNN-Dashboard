## How Analytics Find High-Quality Opportunities

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Scoring

Traditional lead scoring often focuses on single dimensions (e.g., revenue). Our analytics combine:
- **Financial metrics** (turnover, transaction volume)
- **Network value** (ecosystem position, influence)
- **Relationship potential** (NTB status, anchor proximity)
- **Behavioral patterns** (transaction patterns, digital adoption)

This multi-dimensional approach identifies leads that might score low on one dimension but high on others, revealing hidden opportunities.

### 2. Network-Based Discovery

**Ecosystem Relationships**:
- Accounts connected to high-value accounts are often high-value themselves
- Bridge accounts connecting different ecosystems have strategic value
- Hub accounts can unlock multiple opportunities through referrals

**RM Action**:
- Use network analysis to identify ecosystem expansion opportunities
- Target accounts connected to strategic accounts
- Leverage bridge accounts for cross-anchor opportunities

### 3. Predictive Forecasting

**Revenue Forecasting**:
- Predict future turnover based on historical trends
- Identify growth trajectories
- Plan resource allocation

**Opportunity Forecasting**:
- Predict how opportunity scores will evolve
- Identify accounts with improving potential
- Time outreach for maximum impact

**RM Action**:
- Focus on accounts with positive growth trajectories
- Proactively engage accounts before they become high-value
- Plan long-term relationship strategies

### 4. Risk-Adjusted Prioritization

**Churn Risk Integration**:
- High-value accounts with high churn risk need immediate attention
- Low-value accounts with low churn risk can wait
- Balance between acquisition and retention

**RM Action**:
- Prioritize retention of high-value, high-risk accounts
- Balance time between acquisition and retention
- Optimize portfolio health
